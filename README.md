# Formula 1 - Web Scraping Project
Web scraping project that scraped Formula 1 racing data from 2012 to 2021 for exploratory data analysis and data visualisation. 

This project used the information found on Formula 1's official website to scrape information about drivers, teams, points, starting positions, and finishing positions. This information was then cleaned and further insights were found, including:

* Who is the most consistent driver? 
* What are the top performing teams of the last decade of Formula 1?
